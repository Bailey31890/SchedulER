Product Overview
  The purpose of SchedulER is for Embry Riddle Studetns to be able to input majors, minors, and classes previously taken. The program will then develop schedules for the students next semester, and create a 4 year plan for the student to graduate on time at their intended graduation date.
  
The program is launched from the loginGUI.java file, and all interactions from thereforward are handled by the user.
  
The user will input a username, password, their major, and previously taken courses. The program will then analyze their courses in comparison to their major, and generate a viable schedule for upcoming courses.

Each user will create a profile that can be accessed at a later time. Due to the FEMA act of 1974, all user information concerning academic status are kept confidential.

The user first sees a login page, with the ability to create an account as well. If this is a brand new account being created, the user must then input a username, password, major, and previously taken courses. Upon entering the programs homepage, the student has the ability to go to different tabs. These different tabs allow the user to view their own information, edit their information, and generate viable schedules. Upon close, the users information is protected, and their login is saved.
