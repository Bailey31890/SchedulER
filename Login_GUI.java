/**
 * IF LOGGING IN TO CREATED PROFILE:
 * During login, this class will have methods to check for available usernames. If
 * the input username matches any available username, the methods will then check
 * the input password to see if it matches the password linked with the found
 * username.
 * Login GUI will be the main interface after the SchedulER launcher. After login
 * is complete, this will then open up the main dashboard where users can create
 * schedules and change user settings.
 * 
 * IF CREATING AN ACCOUNT:
 * If the user picks the "Create Account" option from the launcher page, they will
 * enter a username and password. The username will be checked against existing
 * usernames so that two usernames will not be identical.
 * The password would then be checked against password standards for a practical
 * safe password. The user would the be shown the "class input" page to continue
 * creating their profile.
